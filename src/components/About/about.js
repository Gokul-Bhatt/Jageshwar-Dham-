    <p>
      A serene temple town located in the Almora district of Uttarakhand,
      Jageshwar is a cluster of more than 100 stone temples, dedicated to Lord
      Shiva, which have inspired its popular name, “Valley of Gods”. Some
      small, while others very prominent, the temples reflect the finest
      architecture and are set against a backdrop of verdant mountains and the
      sparkling Jat Ganga stream. A heritage site protected under the
      Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the temple complex has around 125
      temples and around 174 sculptures, including idols of Lord Shiva and
      Parvati. Over 25 inscriptions have been found on the walls and pillars
      of some of these temples. According to the ASI, the temples are
      estimated to be about 2,500 years old and belong to the post-Gupta and
      pre-medieval eras. They were mostly built and renovated by the Katyuri
      dynasty kings. In recent years, a red sandstone pillar has also been
      discovered here with engraved figures of humans and spiritual figures.
      The pillar is said to be built in 1st century BC. Jageshwar draws crowds
      during the Jageshwar Monsoon Festival, in the month of August, and
      during the Shivratri Mela, in spring.

        by Adi Shankaracharya. It was customary for pilgrims on way to Kailash
        Mansarovar route to stop and worship Lord Shiva here and seek his
        blessings. This area was also centre of Lakulisha Shaivism, a
        revivalist sect worshipping Lord Shiva. Saint Lakulisha, name
        literally meaning, club-bearing Lord, was a wandering ascetic who is

        Pashupati. This faith later flourished under Bharashiva and Vakataka
        dynasties of southern and central India. Piligrims who came after

        incarnations of Lord Shiva, as mentioned in the Puranas. It is
